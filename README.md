# Python-Training
- This repository helps beginers to learn python (basic and advanced). Here, I attached some advanced topics (e.g. Python log framework, JSON and XML parsing, Socket programming, Python Unit testing, Python Jinja, Python Turtle and Inter Process Communication in OS). I also added some example code to give you a basic scenario on advanced topics.

- For basic python, I attached two PDF files and some assignments links. You can read those PDFs and do practise of those assignments. I also provided few solutions of those assignments.

- There is also a course plan from where you can check you day to day progress on python.

- For Linux user, there is no need install Python manually. You will get Python 2.7 by default. But, if you want to use Python 3 then manual installation is required. 

## Note: I wrote all these code using Python 2.7 framework.
